As I took the course "Cross-culture Communication" this semester, I am required to write 5 journals in total. It is a good time to reflect upon myself, so I have decided to post all of them here.

## How I Communicate with Others @ 2025-03-11, week 3

There are lots of people around me in my life - classmates, teachers, friends, and family members. As I reflect on my communication style, I realize how it varies across these different contexts.

First and foremost, I prioritize accuracy in my communication. I tend to be straightforward, focusing on what is *true* rather than what is *good*. This approach reflects my inclination towards rationality: I value facts over flattery. If someone asks for my honest opinion, I provide it directly, even if it may be difficult to hear.

When it comes to teachers, I am always respectful. I enjoy engaging in discussions with them, as it allows me to learn more and deepen my understanding of various topics. ~~These interactions often lead to me being seen as the "good boy" by all of my teachers.~~ I believe that maintaining a respectful and enthusiastic attitude toward learning not only benefits me academically but also fosters positive relationships with my teachers.

With my family, I am caring and considerate. When I talk to my parents, I always try to stand in their shoes and avoid conflicts as much as I could. I’ve been attending boarding school since I was six, and I only return home on weekends. I have a younger brother(who just turned 10 yesterday!), and I try to be as independent as possible, so my parents can focus on raising my younger brother without worrying too much about me. I believe I can take care of myself, and I want them to have peace of mind knowing I'm self-sufficient and responsible.

I am also kind and warm-hearted towards my classmates. Cooperating well with others maximizes everyone's academic and personal growth. Therefore, I make an effort to be amiable and inclusive. In my view, classmates, teachers, and friends are valuable resources, and maintaining healthy relationships with them is essential. 

As I've grown older, I've noticed that I get angry less frequently. In fact, I can't remember the last time I was truly mad - it might have been four years ago. I see this as a sign of maturity. Adolescence often brings intense emotions, but I've grown better at regulating my feelings. When I communicate with others and have an intense conflict, I remind myself to stay calm and composed by taking deep breaths and rationalizing the situation objectively.

However, there are times when I dislike someone. People who are condescending, arrogant, or lazy often fall into this category. I have little patience for those who consistently disregard others' efforts, fail to take responsibility, or exhibit a lack of respect for others. In those cases, I choose to distance myself and treat them with indifference, refusing to communicate with them.

This is *me*.
