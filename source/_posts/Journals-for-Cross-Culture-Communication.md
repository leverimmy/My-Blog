As I took the course "Cross-culture Communication" this semester, I am required to write 5 journals in total. It is a good time to reflect upon myself, so I have decided to post all of them here.

## How I Communicate with Others @ 2025-03-11, Week 3

There are lots of people around me in my life - classmates, teachers, friends, and family members. As I reflect on my communication style, I realize how it varies across these different contexts.

First and foremost, I prioritize accuracy in my communication. I tend to be straightforward, focusing on what is *true* rather than what is *good*. This approach reflects my inclination towards rationality: I value facts over flattery. If someone asks for my honest opinion, I provide it directly, even if it may be difficult to hear.

When it comes to teachers, I am always respectful. I enjoy engaging in discussions with them, as it allows me to learn more and deepen my understanding of various topics. ~~These interactions often lead to me being seen as the "good boy" by all of my teachers.~~ I believe that maintaining a respectful and enthusiastic attitude toward learning not only benefits me academically but also fosters positive relationships with my teachers.

With my family, I am caring and considerate. When I talk to my parents, I always try to stand in their shoes and avoid conflicts as much as I could. I've been attending boarding school since I was six, and I only return home on weekends. I have a younger brother(who just turned 10 yesterday!), and I try to be as independent as possible, so my parents can focus on raising my younger brother without worrying too much about me. I believe I can take care of myself, and I want them to have peace of mind knowing I'm self-sufficient and responsible.

I am also kind and warm-hearted towards my classmates. Cooperating well with others maximizes everyone's academic and personal growth. Therefore, I make an effort to be amiable and inclusive. In my view, classmates, teachers, and friends are valuable resources, and maintaining healthy relationships with them is essential. 

As I've grown older, I've noticed that I get angry less frequently. In fact, I can't remember the last time I was truly mad - it might have been four years ago. I see this as a sign of maturity. Adolescence often brings intense emotions, but I've grown better at regulating my feelings. When I communicate with others and have an intense conflict, I remind myself to stay calm and composed by taking deep breaths and rationalizing the situation objectively.

However, there are times when I dislike someone. People who are condescending, arrogant, or lazy often fall into this category. I have little patience for those who consistently disregard others' efforts, fail to take responsibility, or exhibit a lack of respect for others. In those cases, I choose to distance myself and treat them with indifference, refusing to communicate with them.

This is *me*.

## Film Review for *Lost in Translation* @ 2025-03-21, Week 5

I watched the film *Lost in Translation* last weekend, and it left a refreshing and thought-provoking impression on my mind. The movie manages to explore the themes of loneliness and cultural disconnection.

Having visited Japan last summer, I found myself reflecting on the cultural differences portrayed in the movie. Unlike Bob, I didn't experience the same level of culture shock during my trip. Perhaps this is because I am Chinese, and the similarities between Japanese Kanji and Chinese characters made navigating Japan much easier for me. Additionally, the physical appearance of Japanese people closely resembles that of Chinese people, which helped me blend into the crowd without feeling out of place. For Bob, however, the cultural and linguistic barriers in Tokyo were a source of alienation, which was a recurring theme in the film.

Several scenes from the movie stood out to me. One of the most memorable was the karaoke scene, where Bob and Charlotte bond over music in a private karaoke room. The scene is both lively and intimate, showcasing the rare moments of joy and connection they share amidst their personal struggles. However, when the karaoke ended, there was a moment of silence between Bob and Charlotte. This pause, filled with unspoken emotions, highlighted the depth of their connection. It perfectly captures the bittersweet contrast between their growing friendship and the loneliness they both feel in their lives.

Another impactful moment is when Bob participates in a commercial shoot for Suntory whisky. The exaggerated gestures and over-the-top direction from the Japanese director highlight the cultural divide, as Bob struggles to understand what is being asked of him. It's a humorous yet poignant scene that underscores his sense of disconnection in an unfamiliar culture. ~~Perhaps the staff, whose translation skill was too poor, should be responsible for this.~~

Reflecting on my own experiences, I realize my cultural encounters differ greatly from Bob's. While he struggled with cultural disorientation in Japan, I felt at ease during my visit. However, I do recall experiencing re-entry shock after returning to my hometown Wuhan from the United States when I was in fifth grade. The jet lag was intense - I couldn't sleep well for an entire week and often woke up at five in the morning, unable to fall back asleep. It was disconcerting for someone so young. What's more, I found myself temporarily struggling to speak Chinese as fluently as I used to, which felt odd and even amusing.

In conclusion, *Lost in Translation* is a beautiful film that captures the complexities of cultural disconnection and human relationships. Its subtle storytelling and relatable themes make it a timeless piece of cinema that continues to resonate with audiences, myself included.

## I Belong to a High-Context Cultural Dimension @ 2025-04-05, Week 7

I've never considered whether I belong to a high-context or low-context cultural dimension before - this question only came to my attention when I started to write this journal.

I was raised in a traditional Chinese family, which has many of the typical stereotypes of an East-Asian upbringing. As a child, I attended plenty of extracurricular lessons and participated in various sports. During traditional festivals throughout the year, I was expected to visit relatives and offer greetings, even if I didn't really know them. This was likely done to maintain my parents' "face," a concept deeply rooted in our culture.

A recent experience illustrates well that I hold a high-context culture point of view. Last Sunday, an online friend of mine and I scheduled to play table tennis at the North Gymnasium. We did play table tennis, but his skills were not compatible to mine, and I found the experience rather unpleasant. However, since we are classmates, I refrained from pointing this out directly. Instead, I decided that if a similar situation arises in the future, I would politely decline with an excuse.

In my culture, the concept of "face" plays a significant role in social interactions. "Face" refers to a person's reputation, dignity, and social standing, and it is something that should be carefully maintained and respected. Losing face can be deeply embarrassing, while giving face to others is seen as a sign of respect and consideration.

For example, when I communicate with others, I often prioritize harmony and avoid direct confrontation. If someone makes a mistake, I might choose to address it indirectly or let it slide to preserve their dignity. Similarly, when I receive compliments, I tend to downplay my achievements to appear humble and avoid making others feel uncomfortable.

This cultural emphasis on "face" influences how I communicate and behave in various situations. It encourages me to be mindful of others' feelings and to approach conflicts with tact and sensitivity. While this approach may sometimes feel restrictive, I believe it fosters a sense of mutual respect and understanding in my relationships.

## Memes as a Unifying Force in Cross-Cultural Humor @ 2025-04-26, Week 10

The use of memes and GIFs in cross-cultural humor can have both connecting and misunderstanding effects. From my point of view, it does more good than harm. On the positive side, these visual formats transcend language barriers and allow for humor to be shared globally. Though memes and GIFs rely on universal themes, relatable experiences, and exaggerated expressions, all of which may lead to misinterpretation and unintended offense, my point is that they provide a common visual vocabulary that enables people from different backgrounds to engage with and relate to the same comedic content. Even if they don't speak the same language, they can still possibly infer the meaning.

The rapid spread of memes online further reinforces this sense of cross-cultural connection. When the same meme or GIF goes viral, it allows people from diverse parts of the world to instantly share and react to the same joke. This fosters a collective experience of humor that bridges geographical and linguistic divides, creating a unifying force through laughter.

It's true that some memes or GIFs can also lead to misunderstandings. Humor is highly contextual, and visual jokes can bring unintended meanings when viewed from outside of their original cultural framework. Additionally, not all cultures may share the same references or find the same things funny.

However, despite these risks of misinterpretation, the increasing use of memes and GIFs has been a positive tide in modern cross-cultural humor. The shared visual language they provide helps connect people, sparking moments of levity and collective amusement that transcend cultural boundaries. Ultimately, the ability of these formats to foster connection outweighs their potential for occasional misunderstanding.

## Cross-Cultural Communication: Bridging Various Cultures Across the Globe @ 2025-05-18, Week 13

A crucial takeaway from this course - "Cross-Cultural Communication", is the development of effective conflict resolution strategies in intercultural contexts.

While conflict is an inherent aspect of human interaction, its manifestation, interpretation, and resolution are profoundly shaped by cultural norms and values. What one culture considers a direct and assertive approach to conflict resolution might be perceived as aggressive and disrespectful in another. Conversely, strategies that prioritize harmony and saving face, common in some cultures, could be viewed as evasive or unproductive in those that value open confrontation.

A key focus of this course is the identification and analysis of cultural dimensions. Frameworks such as Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory (e.g., individualism vs. collectivism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance) and Hall's high-context vs. low-context communication styles provide valuable lenses through which to understand and compare different cultural approaches. By examining these dimensions, students gain a deeper appreciation for the diverse ways in which societies organize themselves, prioritize values, and convey meaning.

Furthermore, when I was attending the class, I was immersed in the impact of cultural differences on specific contexts, such as business negotiations, teamwork, conflict resolution, and social interactions. Through case studies, simulations, and discussions, I am pretty sure that I have developd practical skills for navigating these situations effectively. I learnt to adapt their communication styles, build rapport across cultural divides, and find common ground to achieve shared objectives.

One notable change involves my assumption about the universality of communication styles. I initially thought that while languages might differ, fundamental communication principles like directness and clarity were universally valued and understood in the same way. If I wanted to convey something effectively, being straightforward and explicit seemed like the most logical and honest approach. However, the course illuminated the profound cultural variations in communication styles. I learned about high-context cultures where meaning is often embedded in the context, relationships, and non-verbal cues, making directness potentially jarring or even rude. Conversely, in low-context cultures, explicitness is highly valued for clarity and efficiency. This understanding has tempered my default inclination towards directness, making me more attuned to the potential for misinterpretation in different cultural settings and more conscious of the need to adapt my style to be more context-aware and sensitive to indirect communication cues.

In conclusion, this course offers invaluable insights and practical skills for navigating our increasingly diverse world. The ability to communicate effectively across cultures is not just a professional advantage; it is a fundamental skill for fostering understanding, empathy, and collaboration in all aspects of life.
