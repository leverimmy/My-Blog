As I took the course "Cross-culture Communication" this semester, I am required to write 5 journals in total. It is a good time to reflect upon myself, so I have decided to post all of them here.

## How I Communicate with Others @ 2025-03-11, week 3

There are lots of people around me in my life - classmates, teachers, friends, and family members. As I reflect on my communication style, I realize how it varies across these different contexts.

First and foremost, I prioritize accuracy in my communication. I tend to be straightforward, focusing on what is *true* rather than what is *good*. This approach reflects my inclination towards rationality: I value facts over flattery. If someone asks for my honest opinion, I provide it directly, even if it may be difficult to hear.

When it comes to teachers, I am always respectful. I enjoy engaging in discussions with them, as it allows me to learn more and deepen my understanding of various topics. ~~These interactions often lead to me being seen as the "good boy" by all of my teachers.~~ I believe that maintaining a respectful and enthusiastic attitude toward learning not only benefits me academically but also fosters positive relationships with my teachers.

With my family, I am caring and considerate. When I talk to my parents, I always try to stand in their shoes and avoid conflicts as much as I could. I've been attending boarding school since I was six, and I only return home on weekends. I have a younger brother(who just turned 10 yesterday!), and I try to be as independent as possible, so my parents can focus on raising my younger brother without worrying too much about me. I believe I can take care of myself, and I want them to have peace of mind knowing I'm self-sufficient and responsible.

I am also kind and warm-hearted towards my classmates. Cooperating well with others maximizes everyone's academic and personal growth. Therefore, I make an effort to be amiable and inclusive. In my view, classmates, teachers, and friends are valuable resources, and maintaining healthy relationships with them is essential. 

As I've grown older, I've noticed that I get angry less frequently. In fact, I can't remember the last time I was truly mad - it might have been four years ago. I see this as a sign of maturity. Adolescence often brings intense emotions, but I've grown better at regulating my feelings. When I communicate with others and have an intense conflict, I remind myself to stay calm and composed by taking deep breaths and rationalizing the situation objectively.

However, there are times when I dislike someone. People who are condescending, arrogant, or lazy often fall into this category. I have little patience for those who consistently disregard others' efforts, fail to take responsibility, or exhibit a lack of respect for others. In those cases, I choose to distance myself and treat them with indifference, refusing to communicate with them.

This is *me*.

## Film Review for *Lost in Translation* @ 2025-03-21, week 5

I watched the film *Lost in Translation* last weekend, and it left a refreshing and thought-provoking impression on my mind. The movie manages to explore the themes of loneliness and cultural disconnection.

Having visited Japan last summer, I found myself reflecting on the cultural differences portrayed in the movie. Unlike Bob, I didn't experience the same level of culture shock during my trip. Perhaps this is because I am Chinese, and the similarities between Japanese Kanji and Chinese characters made navigating Japan much easier for me. Additionally, the physical appearance of Japanese people closely resembles that of Chinese people, which helped me blend into the crowd without feeling out of place. For Bob, however, the cultural and linguistic barriers in Tokyo were a source of alienation, which was a recurring theme in the film.

Several scenes from the movie stood out to me. One of the most memorable was the karaoke scene, where Bob and Charlotte bond over music in a private karaoke room. The scene is both lively and intimate, showcasing the rare moments of joy and connection they share amidst their personal struggles. However, when the karaoke ended, there was a moment of silence between Bob and Charlotte. This pause, filled with unspoken emotions, highlighted the depth of their connection. It perfectly captures the bittersweet contrast between their growing friendship and the loneliness they both feel in their lives.

Another impactful moment is when Bob participates in a commercial shoot for Suntory whisky. The exaggerated gestures and over-the-top direction from the Japanese director highlight the cultural divide, as Bob struggles to understand what is being asked of him. It's a humorous yet poignant scene that underscores his sense of disconnection in an unfamiliar culture. ~~Perhaps the staff, whose translation skill was too poor, should be responsible for this.~~

Reflecting on my own experiences, I realize my cultural encounters differ greatly from Bob's. While he struggled with cultural disorientation in Japan, I felt at ease during my visit. However, I do recall experiencing re-entry shock after returning to my hometown Wuhan from the United States when I was in fifth grade. The jet lag was intense - I couldn't sleep well for an entire week and often woke up at five in the morning, unable to fall back asleep. It was disconcerting for someone so young. What's more, I found myself temporarily struggling to speak Chinese as fluently as I used to, which felt odd and even amusing.

In conclusion, *Lost in Translation* is a beautiful film that captures the complexities of cultural disconnection and human relationships. Its subtle storytelling and relatable themes make it a timeless piece of cinema that continues to resonate with audiences, myself included.
